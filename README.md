# Reverse Me

Reverse Me or "I hate portals" was a challenge made by [Disconnect3d](https://disconnect3d.pl) for [Python Challenges 2018](https://www.python-challenges.com) competition held at [PyCon PL 2018](https://pl.pycon.org/2018/en/).

The challenge requires user to find out three flags that are hidden in the Python script that is being executed. The catch is: the challenges source code cannot be read. At least not that easy.

**The challenge is not hosted there anymore, but with the source code in this repo, you can host it locally or on your machine.**

## Launching the challenge locally

Clone the repo, go to `src` and fire `./build_and_launch.sh`. This will build a docker image that will run nsjail and expose it on 31337 port.

NOTE: This requires `docker` to be installed and uses an unofficial docker image `disconnect3d/nsjail`. Yeah, this is my image.

## Configuration and writeups

I am going to create 1-2 videos about the challenge, different solutions and how it's hosted.
Stay tuned! o/
